Internet-Draft  Test Vectors for the Stream Cipher ChaCha   October 2013


1.  Introduction

   The ChaCha [ChaCha] algorithm is a fairly new stream cipher that is
   getting some attention.  ChaCha has been proposed as a replacement
   for RC4 [RC4] and ChaCha is also used in a few protocols.

   In order to efficiently implement the algorithm and ensure
   interoperability between different implementations, it is of great
   importance to be able to verify that a given implementation is
   functionally correct.  Test vectors aids this verification by
   providing a known correct answer.

   Unfortunately, for ChaCha there are no test vectors published.  This
   Internet Draft tries to rectify this by providing test vectors for
   ChaCha.


2.  Description of the test Vectors

   The test vectors describes in this document is given as a number of
   test cases.  For each test case there is a number of test vectors and
   known answers.  The test vectors in a test case has been generated
   with support for:

      128 and 256 bit keys.
      8, 12 and 20 rounds

   This means that for a given test case there are 6 different test
   vectors.  Each of these test vectors contains the keystream for two
   64 byte blocks.

   In order to further support implementation work, each test vector
   also contains the internal state of the cipher after the first and
   the second block respectively.

   The test vectors in this I-D has been generated by a simple generator
   based on the chacha.c [chacha.c] reference model by Daniel J
   Bernstein.  The generator has been verified to generate the same
   values as the reference model. reference model.

   All zero input data blocks, that is 64 bytes with the value of 0x00
   has been used during generation.  Since ChaCha is a stream cipher and
   encryption, decryption is done by XOR-ing the data with the
   keystream.  By using all zero data blocks we get the keystream
   itself.

   The test vector generator is available as a stand alone c program in
   the chacha_testvectors [chacha_testvectors] project on Github.
